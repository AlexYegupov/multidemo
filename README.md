## Code editors

### Emacs

  run via pnpify (`yarn pnpify emacs .`) at the project root and use `flycheck-mode`, `web-mode`, `tide-mode`

### VScode

   –ê `jump to definition` for the local workspace works if packages in `package.json` declared as:

  ```
  "myLocalPackage": "workspace:^"
  ```

  run to configure:
    ```
    yarn dlx @yarnpkg/sdks vscode
    ```

  Note: to make vscode jump to sources work required those root dev packages:
    "eslint": "^8.52.0",
    "prettier": "^3.0.3",
    "typescript": "^5.1.6"

  Also seems like with typescript 5.2 "go to definition" not works

  What should work in vscode:
   - correctly show typescript & jsx syntax
   - prettier code autofix
   - eslint show errors and can call "Eslint: fix all auto-fixable problems"
   - "go to definition should work (including other workspaces libraries)
